# AeroFusion: Autonomous Control for Biologically-inspired, Lighter-than-air, Instructional, Mechatronics Program (BLIMP) Navigation and Sensor Integration Platform

## 1. Repository Structure Review

## Introduction

Before diving into the project details, we reviewed the cloned template to understand how the folder structure translates to the website. We removed all markdown pages except for **index.md** to prepare the report. This clean setup ensures that our final website only displays the main home page, keeping the structure clear and uncluttered.

## 3. Project Plan

### 3.1 High-Level Concept and Research Question

Our project aims to to develop an integrated, sensor-driven framework that enables an Biologically-inspired, Lighter-than-air, Instructional, Mechatronics Program (BLIMP) UAV to operate autonomously in dynamic and uncertain environments. 

integrate a UR5 robotic arm with a quadruped robot to facilitate advanced experimental setups. The central research question is: **"How effectively can sensor data and simulation models be integrated to enhance the real-time control and autonomy of a hybrid robotic system?"**  
The experiment involves using the UR5 to position the quadruped at a designated start point, triggering the quadruped to run in a specified direction, and collecting sensor data during its motion. We then broadcast this data to a server for analysis, comparing it with simulated data. The refined simulation results are subsequently applied back to the robot to evaluate improvements in performance.
